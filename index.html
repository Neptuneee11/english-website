                        More people are being imprisoned compared to those being released. In national prisons, 
                        30%-40% of the PDL cases are on appeal and are pending for final judgment which means 
                        that, once dismissed, PDLs are acquitted and deemed innocent. Additionally, about 80% 
                        of PDLs are not convicted which means they're innocent in the eyes of the law. Of these, 
                        75% have bailable cases however a significant number of PDLs are poor and thus cannot 
                        afford bail. Yet, for most, privileged and influential people get much faster decisions 
                        when it comes to their hearing and case progress.
